If you want to test RAMAS we suggest you use the following file:
[Dump in DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6s90z940wxozm8z/ultimateDump?dl=0)
This file was used during testing and represents a fairly large dump from a 4GB machine preprocessed to a smaller size using the strings program. It can be directly used in RAMAS.
