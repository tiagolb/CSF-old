{"name":"RAMAS","tagline":"RAM Analysis System","body":"RAMAS\r\n=====\r\n\r\nRAM Analysis System is an extensible memory forensics analysis tool for linux which is able to capture useful data from instant-messaging and email client applications through the matching of regular expressions. Although we employ a general memory data carving approach, we argue that our tool is a valuable asset in a digital forensic investigator's kit, so as to ease the automatic extraction of relevant communication data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only available tool aimed at extracting and building a timeline of the communications taken forth by a given suspect.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupported Applications\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nAs of this moment the supported (of the shelf) applications are the following:\r\n\r\n* Facebook Chat Messages (and Messenger)\r\n* Twitter Direct Messages\r\n* Skype Web Client\r\n* Roundcube Email Client\r\n* Pidgin Desktop Client\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo extract data using RAMAS, check the following command for help:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python ramas.py extract --help\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo extract the memory dump we suggest the use of DumpIt, a tool for Windows which was used for the development of this system.\r\nDumpIt generates a RAW dump file which can then be given as input to strings (linux CLI program) so it can extract the strings to another file which can then be given as input RAMAS.\r\n\r\nA simple example to extract chat messages from Facebook and present the results with HTML:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ strings RAW_DUMP_FILE > STRINGS_DUMP_FILE\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python ramas.py extract -f STRINGS_DUMP_FILE -t facebook --html --threads\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this command is executed, a folder called audit_result/ is created and in it are the results of this audit. If the HTML flag is used, then a file called audit.html is generated as an entry point for the results.\r\n\r\n\r\nExtension Development\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nTo develop new modules for RAMAS, the following command is available:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python ramas.py create\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command creates a directory called external/ which contains two files:\r\n\r\n- project\r\n    * ramas.py\r\n    * (...)\r\n    * external/\r\n        * __init__.py  \r\n        * newModule.py\r\n\r\nBoth of these files need to be edited so the new module can be installed. Rename newModule.py file to whatever name you desire and modify the three classes which compose RAMAS' API:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport outputs\r\n\r\nclass NewModulePreProcesser:\r\n    def process(self, input_filename, output_file):\r\n        # to be implemented\r\n\r\nclass NewModuleParser:\r\n    def get_timeline(self, input_file):\r\n        # to be implemented\r\n\r\nclass NewModuleOutput(outputs.OutputFactory):\r\n    def text_code(self, input_list):\r\n        # to be implemented\r\n\r\n    def html_code(self, input_list):\r\n        # to be implemented\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can edit the name of these classes but not the name of these functions!\r\n\r\nNext you'll need to edit the `__init__.py` file with the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport newModule\r\nMODULES = {\r\n  'newModule' : [\r\n    newModule.NewModuleParser(),\r\n    newModule.NewModuleOutput(),\r\n    newModule.NewModulePreProcesser()\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere you replace newModule with the name you have given to the module file. After this you can execute the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python ramas.py extract --help\r\n```\r\n\r\nto check if the new module is installed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthors\r\n-------\r\n\r\n@tiagolb\r\n@dmbb\r\n@magicknot\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis tool was developed for Forensic Cyber Security course at IST (https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt).\r\nThis tool was tested for the Chrome Web Browser running on a Windows 7 machine.\r\n\r\nThis project has been set up using PyScaffold 2.4.2.
